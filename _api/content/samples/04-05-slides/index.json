On the web and in apps, you can click through the slides. In print, you’ll see one summary slide, and step-by-step text below the image describing each stage in the slide sequence. In epub, you’ll see the summary slide, then each slide in turn, with its slide caption. See the docs for how to create a slide sequence like this. <img src='images/web/cats-a.jpg' srcset='images/web/cats-a-320.jpg 320w, images/web/cats-a-640.jpg 640w, images/web/cats-a-1024.jpg 1024w, images/web/cats-a.jpg 1280w' sizes='(max-width: 320px) 320px, (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 640px) 640px, (min-width: 640px) and (max-width: 1024px) 1024px, (min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw' title='Simple ovals capture main body parts' alt='A series of ovals of varying sizes positioned at important junctions and capturing some of the main body parts.
