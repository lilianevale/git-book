LaTeX-style maths via MathJax can be inline (E=mc2E = mc^2) or displayed: Pt+1−Pt=b+ds(Pt−¯P)P_{t+1} - P_t=frac{b+d}{s}(P_t-overline{P}) The maths above and below is borrowed and adapted from The Economy by CORE. Pt+2−Pt+1=b+ds(Pt+1−¯P)P_{t+2} - P_{t+1}=frac{b+d}{s}(P_{t+1}-overline{P}) It follows from Pt=¯P−sb+dEtP_{t} = overset{overline{}}{P} - frac{s}{b + d}E_{t} , Et=Pt+1−PtE_{t} = P_{t + 1} - P_{t} and the equation above that Pt+2−Pt+1Pt+1−Pt=Pt+1−¯PPt−¯P=Rbegin{align} frac{P_{t+2} - P_{t+1}}{P_{t+1} - P_{t}} &=  frac{P_{t+1}-overline{P}}{ P_{t}-overline{P}} &= R end{align}"}
